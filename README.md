# CS-255-R1994-System-Analysis-and-Design
A repository that highlights the academic work done in Systems Analysis and Design course for CS undergrad.

•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client DriverPass requested that a system be built for their company that would provide a competitive edge in the market of educational resources for driver’s education. They noticed that there was a demand for student driver resources and a strong correlation of number of students who fail due to lack of resources. Thus, DriverPass requested that a web-based system be built to minimize the amount of system requirements and allow accessibility to a wide range of students.

•	What did you do particularly well?

I feel that I did particularly well on gathering all the requirements after performing requirement analysis on the transcripts from the stakeholders. It was very easy to determine and categorize which requirements were functional or non-function. Which only then created a baseline to easily implement both process models and object models.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Having more time, I really like to go back and revise all the UML diagrams. I feel that these were simple and beginner designs as a lot of details might be missing. I feel that it requires a great deal experience and design theory to really nail down the designs and not miss details. Not only is it wise to nail down every aspect of the design, but great design logic leads to efficient clean code that is easy to maintain and reduces costs for stakeholders. The costs of errors before implementation will be minimal compared to fixing errors of systems that are already in operations.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I feel that I did very well gathering all the needs and implemented them into my system of what was agreed upon in the transcripts. However, due to inexperience, I would imagine that there are errors and things that I could dramatically improve on to create an effective design. As stated above, it is very important to truly capture the story of what the stakeholders want. If one cannot write this down in design, then they truly do not understand the problem that needs to be solved. In addition, poor design will only lead to more cost once the system is in operation and not only damage reputation with stakeholder but leave them unsatisfied.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I really did enjoy this course and learning the different types of modeling that I am already starting to include into my design documents in my current field. I really want to take the time and reread the material as capturing the design and being sound in logic is highly important to building a great product. I am going to implement all the things I learned in this course to designing products as I see the need of importance of diagrams to model the logic. Without truly understanding how to solve the problem logically before ever implementing code will only lead to errors and unsatisfied customers. I really liked the use of the Gantt chart, Data Flow Diagrams, and all the UML diagrams I created in the final project. I look forward to learning more design theory to truly write clean code as a software engineer.
